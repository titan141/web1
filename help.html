<!-- 1. <!DOCTYPE html>  // All HTML documents must start with a <!DOCTYPE> declaration. The declaration is not an HTML tag. It is an "information" to the browser about what document type to expect. -->

<!-- 2. <html lang="en"> // The lang attribute specifies the language of the element's content. Common examples are "en" for English, "es" for Spanish, "fr" for French and so on. -->

<!-- 3. The <head> element is a container for metadata (data about data) and is placed between the <html> tag and the <body> tag. Metadata is data about the HTML document. Metadata is not displayed. -->

<!-- 4. <meta charset="UTF-8" />//The charset attribute specifies the character encoding for the HTML document. The HTML5 specification encourages web developers to use the UTF-8 character set, which covers almost all of the characters and symbols in the world! -->

<!-- 5.<meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" /> //The http-equiv attribute provides an HTTP header for the information/value of the content attribute. The http-equiv attribute can be used to simulate an HTTP response header. -->

<!-- 6.Example
Refresh document every 30 seconds:
<head>
  <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="30">

<!-- 7.The <meta> tag defines metadata about an HTML document. Metadata is data (information) about data.
<meta> tags always go inside the <head> element, and are typically used to specify character set, page description, keywords, author of the document, and viewport settings.
Metadata will not be displayed on the page, but is machine parsable. Metadata is used by browsers (how to display content or reload page), search engines (keywords), and other web services. There is a method to let web designers take control over the viewport (the user's visible area of a web page), through the <meta> tag -->

<!-- 9. The <body> tag defines the document's body.

<!-- 13. <hr> is used to insert a horizontal line in between (print bold line in between) eg.    <hr size="1" noshade /> -->

<!-- 14. The <p> tag defines a paragraph. Browsers automatically add a single blank line before and after each <p> element. -->

<!-- 15. The <ul> tag defines an unordered (bulleted) list. Use the <ul> tag together with the <li> tag to create unordered lists.
eg. <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
        <li>Coffee</li>
        <li>Tea</li>
        <li>Milk</li>
      </ul> -->

<!-- 18.The <a> tag defines a hyperlink, which is used to link from one page to another.

    The most important attribute of the <a> element is the href attribute, which indicates the link's destination.

    An unvisited link is underlined and blue
    A visited link is underlined and purple
    An active link is underlined and red -->
